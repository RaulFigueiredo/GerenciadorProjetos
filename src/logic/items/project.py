"""
This module defines the Project class, which implements the IItem interface.
It represents a project with various attributes and methods to manage its lifecycle.

Classes:
    Project: Represents a project with attributes such as name, label, end date,
    description, creation date, conclusion date, status, and associated tasks.
    It provides methods for project management including adding, deleting, updating
    tasks, and setting the project's conclusion status.

Exceptions:
    ItemDontHaveThisAttribute: Raised when trying to update an attribute that doesn't
                               exist in the Project class.
    NonChangeableProperty: Raised when attempting to change a property that is not
                           allowed to be modified.
