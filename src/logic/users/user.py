"""
This module defines the User class, which is an implementation of the IUser interface.
The User class is designed as a singleton, ensuring that only one instance of the user
exists within the application context. It provides methods for managing labels and
projects associated with the user, as well as properties to access the user's attributes.

Classes:
    User (IUser): A singleton class that implements the IUser interface. It provides
    functionality to manage user-specific data such as labels and projects. The User
    class allows adding and removing labels and projects, and provides access to the
    user's name, labels, and projects.

Note:
    The User class follows the Singleton design pattern to ensure that only a single
    instance of the User exists in the application.

class User(IUser):
    """
    A singleton class that implements the IUser interface, representing a user in the application.

    This class ensures that only one instance of a user exists within the application context.
    It provides methods for managing labels and projects associated with the user, as well as
    properties to access the user's name, labels, and projects. The class is designed to be
    initialized only once; subsequent attempts to instantiate it will return the existing instance.

    Attributes:
        _instance (User): A class-level attribute that holds the singleton instance of the User.
        _name (str): The name of the user.
        _labels (List[IItem]): A list of labels associated with the user.
        _projects (List[IItem]): A list of projects associated with the user.

    Methods:
        __new__: A class method to control the instantiation of the User class, ensuring it follows
                 the singleton pattern.
        __init__: Initializes the User instance with a name, labels, and projects. This method is
                  designed to run only once.
        add_label: Adds a label to the user's collection of labels.
        remove_label: Removes a label from the user's collection of labels.
        add_project: Adds a project to the user's collection of projects.
        remove_project: Removes a project from the user's collection of projects.
        Various property getters for accessing user attributes.

        This method checks if an instance of the class already exists. If not, it creates a new

        further initialization attempts.

        Parameters:
            name (str): The name of the user. Used during the first initialization of the instance.
