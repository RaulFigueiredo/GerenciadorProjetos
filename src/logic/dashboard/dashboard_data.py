"""
Module providing a DashboardData class for analyzing task-related metrics.

    This module contains a class, DashboardData, designed to facilitate the
analysis of various task-related metrics based on user projects. It includes 
methods to retrieve statistics such as the total number of tasks, completed tasks
by weekday, tasks ending on time, late tasks, tasks created in specific time frames, and more.

Usage:
    - Initialize the DashboardData class by providing a user object containing project
and task information.
    - Use the update_data method to refresh data based on a specific project name or
retrieve data for all projects.
    - Access different methods to obtain task-related metrics, such as the total number 
of tasks, completed tasks
      by weekday, tasks ending on time, late tasks, tasks created in specific time frames, and more.

Example:
    # Initialize DashboardData with a user object
    dashboard = DashboardData(user)

    # Retrieve the total number of tasks across all projects
    total_tasks = dashboard.get_number_of_tasks()

    # Get the number of tasks finished by each weekday
    tasks_by_weekday = dashboard.get_finished_by_weekday()

    # Update data for a specific project
    dashboard.update_data('ProjectX')

    # Retrieve the number of tasks that will end today
    today_tasks = dashboard.get_number_of_for_today_tasks()
